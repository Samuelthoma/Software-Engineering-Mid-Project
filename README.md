1. Setup the database
    - Prepare the database management system (DBMS), I suggest you to use laragon.
    - Run query.sql 

2. Application usage
    - Access createOrder.php from your localhost to access create order app         
    - Access workOrder.php from your localhost to access work order app 
    - All the history can be seen in your local database, there will be order history table and work history table
